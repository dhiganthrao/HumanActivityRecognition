# Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Data

This repository contains code for a Machine Learning Classifier to classify the activity performed by a human based on sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope data) recorded by a smartphone. 

The original code was written in MatLab, but I have written code in Python to perform the same functionality. 

Two classifier models were used: Decision Trees and Bagging K-NN Classifier. The Bagging K-NN Classifier performed better overall in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score.
